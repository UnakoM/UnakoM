<h1><i>THE BEAUTY OF SUNFLOWERS IN HEALING YOU AND BRIGHTENING YOUR DAY.</i></h1>
<h3><i>BY: Unako Mtjekelo.</i></h3>
<h3><p><i>I think sunflowers are the most beautiful plants in the world. Hi everyone my name is Unako Mtjekelo and my favourite flowers are sunflowers. Sunflowers make me so happy, they brighten my day. I love those beautiful yellow petals and the dark brown center of the Sunflower. When i see a sunflower i feel like im floating and everything starts feeling very virtual and unreal. For me, if i am having troubles in  life i would gather around some sunflowers and after a few hours of medidtation with my sunflowers i will be truly happy and find ways to fix my problems calmly. I think that sunflowers truly explain the type of person i am. For example, when they get sunlight and water they shine and stand tall but as soon as they dont get water or they are placed in the shade. Their heads immediatetly face the ground then the sunflowers look very sad. Just like me when i am around things i love i shine and stand tall, but as soon as those things are taken away from me i slouch and get very sad. THAT is the main reason why i love sunflowers because they make me feel like the sunflower and i have something in common. THANK YOU. I LOVE SUNFLOWERS.</i></p></h3>

<h1><i>my first picture is showing you a beautiful sunflower at its best. THIS SUNFLOWER IS FLOURISHING IN LIFE and very happy.</i></h1>
<h3><i>Sunflowers have yellow petals but that brown center is brown because sunflowers go through a lot to be able to rise up fully and tilt their heads to the sun. If you give me a sunflower my face will glow so much and my smile will become huge. I feel like sunflowers are like most humans probably 99.99% of humans have sunflower like personalities because if you are happy your body language will tell everyone that you are happy and you will be smiling, laughing, dancing just showing people how happy you are. Then as soon as you become angry, sad, lonely or even miserable your body language, your face and even sometimes the tone of your voice will show people that you are not happy. You might start crying or screaming then people will get the sign that you are not okay. That is why i say that most human beings are most likely to behave the same way Sunflower behave.  ot of dirt to be able to stand tall and face the sun. Sunflowers make me feel relaxed. </i></h3>

<h1><i>my second picture is simply presenting how a sunflower looks when it is sad because sunflowers always look happy but they can also get sad sometimes.</i></h1>
 <h3><i> Did you know that the sunflower species is also used as wild bird food, it is also used as life stock forage as well as ornamental in some domestic gardens. When you give someone sunflowers it shows how much you adore someone. Sunflowers get these symbols from their name themselves. Sunflower colors are yellow and that is why they always look vibrant and happy.</i> </h3>

<h1><i>my third picture is showing the yellow and happy sunflowers that i spoke about in the previous paragraph.</i></h1>
<h3><p><i> Sunflowers these days are most common in farms where they are used as food for the livestock. I think that sunflowers are such interesting plants because they are so beautiful and so vibrant. I love the fact that sunflowers can brighten peoples days, can be used during meditation and can calm the mind. When i water sunflowers and watch their heads rise up and face the sun as the day goes by, it is so thereputic for me to see that, giving a sunflower what it loves will make it stand tall and be vibrant throughout the day.</i></p></h3>
